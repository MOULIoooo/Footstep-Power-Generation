# 🔋 Footstep Power Generation using Piezoelectric Sensors

This project demonstrates how to generate electricity from human footsteps using piezoelectric sensors. The mechanical energy generated by walking is converted into electrical energy and stored for later use—such as charging a mobile phone or lighting LEDs. It's a smart way to promote green energy in high-footfall areas like railway stations, malls, and schools.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. When a person steps on the platform, piezo sensors generate AC voltage.
2. The AC is converted to DC using a bridge rectifier.
3. The voltage is regulated and stored in a battery.
4. The stored energy can power low-power devices like mobile chargers or LEDs.
